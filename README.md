# 🛰️ MCIFU2 Spectrograph: Diffraction-Limited NIR Hardware

**PoliMi - INAF MSc Thesis | Magellan Telescope Deployment (2026)**

> Built a diffraction-limited hyperspectral spectrograph for exoplanet atmosphere characterization in Y-J-H bands. Hardware scheduled for deployment at Magellan Observatory, Chile.

## 🔭 Key Features
- **Diffraction-limited NIR optics** for maximum photon capture
- **Zemax-optimized** optical design
- **MATLAB calibration pipeline** for spectral analysis
